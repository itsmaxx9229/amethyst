## About

Amethyst is a lightweight Fabric modpack focused on performance optimization and visual polish. It doesn't change Minecraft's core gameplay; it just makes everything look, feel, and run better. Smoother animations, better UI, shader support, and a collection of carefully picked resource packs to refine the vanilla experience.
